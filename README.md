# Robotics-Automation-QSTP-2020
This repository contains my work of the ROS QSTP 2020 course organised by BITS Pilani, Goa campus.

This course is about learning the Robotics Operating System (ROS)- a software framework designed to make robotics development easier. Gazebo has been used as a robotics simulator to create my robot models and test the code on pre-existing Turtlebot.

This is a six week course, starting with intoduction to Python language and has final project about creating an autonomous ground robot. More on that later!
