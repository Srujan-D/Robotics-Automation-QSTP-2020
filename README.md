# Robotics-Automation-QSTP-2020
This repository contains my work of the ROS QSTP 2020 course organised by BITS Pilani, Goa campus.

ROS stands for Robot Operating System, a open-source robotics middleware (i.e. collection of software frameworks for robot software development). It is currently developed by OSRF/Open Robotics.
QSTP, or Quark Summer Term Project, is a part of the Quark- a technical fest at BITS Pilani, Goa campus. This course was created and mentored by the [Aditya Bidwai](https://github.com/adbidwai), [Atharv Sonwane](https://github.com/threewisemonkeys-as), [Vedant Shah](https://github.com/veds12) and Mohit Chaudhari. I would never have learned so much without them, so a big thanks to all of them.

This course is about learning the Robotics Operating System (ROS)- a software framework designed to make robotics development easier. Gazebo has been used as a robotics simulator to create my robot models and test the code on pre-existing Turtlebot.

This was a five week course. I learned the basics of ROS, the publisher-subscriber and service-client model of communication, programming the Turtlebot to move as per my needs using the topic /cmd_vel. I also learnt about various path planning algorithms, and built a PID controller as part of the course. The final project was about creating an autonomous ground robot. It utilised parts of all the previous work I did in the course. It included working on the Omnibase- a ground based robot package developed by the Electronics and Robotics Club at BITS Pilani, Goa campus. Omnibase was built to simulate the Trotbot, which is a robot designed by them.

The actual tasks of each week have been included in the respective week's directory. Reading those will help the user to understand the code.

Thank you!
