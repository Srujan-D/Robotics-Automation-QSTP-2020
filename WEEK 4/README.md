Path planning is an important part of a working-robot.
It plans out how the robot needs to travel to ensure an optimal collision-free journey from the start node to the end node in such a way that no
harm is brought to the robot.
Keeping this in mind, many basic algorithms have been developed.
Here, I have discussed Probability RoadMap (PRM), Rapidly evolving Random Trees (RRT), RRGraphs and RRT* in brief.
However, there are many more versions of these an many more algorithms to plan an optimal path.
