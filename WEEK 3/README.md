Before reading this, it is advised to see the assignment for week 3.
There are four files in the /scripts directory.
The files "pub_point.py" and "pid_go_to_point.py" are concerned with the first task.
The files "pub_path.py" and "pid_go_to_path.py" are concerned with the second (bonus) task.

For the 2nd task, I have used a self-defined messege 'points.msg' which is available in the /msg directory.
The CMakeLists.txt has been modified to serve for either of the tasks.
